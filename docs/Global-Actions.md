The **Better Rolls 2 for Savage Worlds** module has both pre-defined and custom Global Actions:

## Pre-defined Global Actions

![Global Actions](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade/blob/version_2/docs/img/global-actions.jpg?raw=true)

Global actions are pre-defined global actions that are ready to use. You can choose to disable them, if they should not
be available in your setting.

## Custom Global Actions

![World Global Actions](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade/blob/version_2/docs/img/world-global-actions.jpg?raw=true)

With the World global actions functionality, you can define your own global actions for this world. You need to provide
a JSON file to add them:

![Add a new World Global Action](https://github.com/javierriveracastro/betteroll-swade/blob/version_2/docs/img/new-world-global-action.jpg?raw=true)

Global actions are a json encoded set of instructions that allow the user to customize how **Better Rolls** works.

### Example Action

```json
{
    "id": "LEG",
    "name": "Called Shot: Leg",
    "button_name": "Leg Remover",
    "skillMod": -4,
    "dmgMod": 4,
    "dmgOverride": "",
    "selector_type": "item_type",
    "selector_value": "weapon"
}
```

This piece of json will add an action called "Leg Remover" to every weapon card.
If this action is checked it will add a penalty of 4 to the skill roll and a bonus of 4 to the damage roll.

## Action Definition

### Required fields

* `id`: Any string, needs to be different for each action.
    * **NOTE**: the actions are displayed in order of id, so name appropriately
* `name`: The name of the action.
* `button_name`: The name that will be displayed on the icon. Will be made optional in some update.

### Optional fields

* `skillMod`: A number to be used as a modifier to the related skill roll.
* `dmgMod`: A number that will be used as a modifier for damage roll
* `dmgOverride`: A foundry die expression that will be rolled for damage instead of the weapon default.
* `defaultChecked`: If this key exists the action button will start pinned (marked in red)
    * **NOTE**: using `defaultChecked: "off"` does **NOT** mean the button is by default unchecked. If you don't want
      the button checked by default, do **NOT** put any `defaultChecked` element in.
* `runSkillMacro`: This key will run a macro named like its value after skill roll.
* `runDamageMacro`: This key will run a macro named like its value after damage roll.
* `raiseDamageFormula`: A string, specify here the formula used to add damage in the event of a raise. The default
  formula is "+1d6x", so any substitution should be done in a similar way, i.e. "+1d10x" to add a normal exploding d10.
* `wildDieFormula`: Another string dice formula, this time used for the Wild Die. Remember to specify the exploding. You
  can use an empty string for no wild die.
* `rerollSkillMod`: A number used as a modifier for skill reroll
* `rerollDamageMod`: A number used as a modifier for damage reroll
* `shotsUsed`: A number that makes the action use that number of shots. If the item is a power and the values is a
  simple number it will make it use that number of PPs instead. If the value is a number preceded by a plus or minus
  symbol it will add or subtract that number from the usual PP cost of the power.
* `rof`: Number of trait dice rolled.
* `tnOverride`: A number that is set as the tn of the roll. Note that this takes precedence from other ways of setting
  the target number like targeting. This option accepts the special value "Parry", when it is present and there is a
  targeted token, it will set the TN of the roll to the Parry value of that token.
* `extra_text`: Extra text to be shown in the card, it accepts HTML.
* `overrideAp`: Override the Armor Penetration value of the item.
* `multiplyDmgMod`: Multiply the final damage by this number.
* `self_add_status`: Add that status to the token making the roll.
* `add_wild_die`: If true a wild die will be added to the roll even if it normally doesn't have one.
* `avoid_exploding_damage`: If this is set to "true" damage will not explode (like when attacking objects)

### Selector fields

This group of fields are used to select when the action is available, you will need to specify a `selector_type` and
a `selector_value` for a simple selection. You can also use `and_selector` and give it a list of simple selectors.

#### selector_type

* `skill`: `'selector_value'` must be a string. The action will be available when the item uses a skill with that name.
* `attribute`: `'selector_value'` must be a string. The action will be available when the attribute named is rolled,
  e.g., strength, agility, spirit, smarts, vigor.
* `item_type`: `'selector_value'` must be another string, a valid SWADE item type; weapon, power, edge, ...
* `actor_name`: `'selector_value'` must be a string. The action will be available to actor that include that string in
  their name.
* `item_name`: `'selector_value'` must be again a string that this time is compared with the item name.
* `actor_has_effect`: Another string selector, will select actors that have an enabled effect whose label contains the
  string.
* `actor_has_edge`: The same, this time it will look for an edge that contains that string.
* `actor_has_hindrance`: Like the last two, but for hindrances.
* `actor_has_major_hindrance`: This one only matches is the hindrance is major.
* `actor_has_ability`: Like the last three, but for special abilities.
* `actor_has_item`: Matches when the actor has an `item` (Weapon, Armor, Shield, Gear, Consumable) with the same name as
  the value *(exact name)*
* `actor_equips_item`: This action will appear when the actor has an item (see above) with the same name as the value
  equipped.
* `all`: It will always show this action.
* `actor_has_joker`: The action will only be available when the actor is in combat and has drawn a joker.
* `target_has_edge`: This action will be available if PRIOR TO CLICKING the icon, the user has selected a target that
  has some edge.
* `target_has_hindrance`: This action is like `actor_has_edge` but fires for target hindrances
* `target_has_major_hindrance`: This other action only fires when the target has a major hindrance that includes the
  text in the value.
* `target_has_effect`: String selector; works similar to `actor_has_effect` but checks for active effects on the target
  instead.
* `item_description_includes`: This action will be shown if the item description or trappings includes the value.
* `actor_additional_stat_xxx`: This action will be present if an actor has an additional stat named xxx and its value is
  equal to what is in `selector_value``. You need to substitute xxx with the additional stat name.
* `item_additional_stat_xxx`: This works like `actor_additional_stat_xxx` but applies to items.
* `faction`: If `selector_value` is `same` this will make the action appear when token from the same disposition is
  targeted. When the value is another it will make the action appear when the targeted token disposition is different
  from acting.
* `gm_action`: A selector with this value will make the action appear in the dm modifiers above the char window.
* `is_wildcard`: This will show the action if the character is a Wildcard. If the value is "false" it will only show the
  card for extras
* `actor_value`: This expects a selector composed of `"path=value"`. Where path is a dot path of actor data (
  like `system.advances.value`) and value a value (like 4). This coerces the values using javascript `==`.
* `item_value`: The same selector as above but for items instead of actors.
* `item_has_damage`: This will show the action if the item has a damage value. The value is ignored.
* `actor_has_skill`: This will show the action if the actor has a skill with the same name as the value.
* `actor_has_item`: This will show the action if the actor has an item with the same name as the value.
* `actor_equips_item`: This action will appear when the actor has an item (see above) with the same name as the value
  equipped, not just owned.
* `range_less_than`: This action will appear when the range between the first token of the acting actor and the targeted
  token is less or equal than value.
* `module_is_not_active`: This action will only be shown when the module with that identifier is not present. It is
  mainly to avoid automation duplication with other modules like the Core Rules.

#### Complex Selectors

* `and_selector`: Takes a list of the above selectors and executes the action if all are true, i.e., `and_selector`. As
  an example the following json will select and item that uses fighting skill and is owned by an actor whose name
  includes John.
* `or_selector`: Takes a list of selectors and executes the action if at least one is true
* `not_selector`: Takes a list of only on selector and executes the action if that selector conditions are NOT met.

#### Example: Basic `and_selector` Selector

```json
  "and_selector": [
{"selector_type": "skill", "selector_value": "fighting"},
{"selector_type": "actor", "selector_value": "John"}
]
```

#### Example: Nested AND and OR Selectors

```json
  "and_selector": [
{
"selector_type": "target_has_edge", "selector_value": "Dodge",
"or_selector": [
{"selector_type": "power", "selector_value": "Bolt"},
{"selector_type": "skill", "selector_value": "Shooting"}
]}
],
```

#### Grouping

This tag lets you group the actions.

* `group`: A string containing a group name, actions with the same name will be shown grouped in the card (in some
  future version)
* `group_single`: If all entries of a group have this option set to true the group will let you select only one of the
  options.

## Macros

The following variables are pre-populated in a macro run from global actions for macro writer convenience.
Note that all info is already stored in the message, all the others are just conveniences.

```js
const actor = actor_param; // The card actor
const item = item_param; // The card item
const speaker = ChatMessage.getSpeaker();
const token = canvas.tokens.get(speaker.token);
const character = game.user.character;
const message = message_param; // The full message object
```

## API

You can define global actions within a module. This let the user activate your module and have all the **Global Actions
** you defined turned on.

You need to load a script in your module. It's recommended to use `Hooks once ready`.

The format of the global action must be like an array of objects. Look at the example.

```js
Hooks.once('ready', () => {
    const groupName = "Savage Pathfinder";

    const BETTER_ROLLS_GLOBAL_ACTIONS = [{
        id: "DESPERATE_ATTACK-2",
        name: "Desperate Attack +2",
        button_name: "Desperate Attack +2",
        skillMod: 2,
        dmgMod: -2,
        dmgOverride: "",
        and_selector: [{
            selector_type: "skill",
            selector_value: "Fighting"
        },
            {
                selector_type: "item_type",
                selector_value: "weapon"
            }
        ],
        group: groupName
    },
        {
            id: "SNEAKATTACK",
            name: "Sneak Attack",
            button_name: "Sneak Attack",
            dmgMod: "+1d6x",
            and_selector: [
                {
                    selector_type: "actor_has_edge",
                    selector_value: "Rogue"
                },
                {
                    selector_type: "item_type",
                    selector_value: "weapon"
                }
            ],
            group: groupName
        }
    ];

    game.brsw.add_actions(BETTER_ROLLS_GLOBAL_ACTIONS);
})
```

It's recommended to add a conditional check to `game.brsw.add_actions` to prevent an error if the Better Rolls module is
not activated.

```js
if (game.modules.get("betterrolls-swade2")?.active) {
    game.brsw.add_actions(BETTER_ROLLS_GLOBAL_ACTIONS);
    ui.notifications.error("Please, activate better rolls module!");
}
```

It's also recommended to add an option to your module settings to let the user turn on this feature, e.g., maybe the
user wants to use their own global actions.

```js
if (game.settings.get("yourModuleID", "TurnOnOrOffMyModuleGlobalActions")) {
    game.brsw.add_actions(BETTER_ROLLS_GLOBAL_ACTIONS);
}
```

### Pathfinder for Savage Worlds

Below is a list of actions for the Savage Pathfinder setting. Some of the basic actions from SWADE (see above) are
applicable as well.

#### Attack Options

SWPF adds new combat options like Desperate Attack which is listed as an example below.

##### Desperate Attack

Due to the nature of Desperate Attack, i.e., either a +2 or +4 to Fighting and subtract like amount from damage, two
global actions are needed:

*NOTE: Desperate Attack has been rolled back into the core Savage Worlds in the "printing v5".*

```json
{
    "id": "DESPERATE_ATTACK-2",
    "name": "Desperate Attack +2",

        },
        {
            "selector_type": "item_type",
            "selector_value": "weapon"
        }
    ],
    "group": "BRSW.AttackOption"
}
```

```json
{
    "id": "DESPERATE_ATTACK-4",
    "name": "Desperate Attack +4",
    "button_name": "Desperate Attack +4",

        {
            "selector_type": "skill",
            "selector_value": "fighting"
        },
        {
            "selector_type": "item_type",
            "selector_value": "weapon"
        }
    ],

}
```
